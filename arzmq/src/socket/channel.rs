/// # A channel socket `ZMQ_CHANNEL`
///
/// A socket of type [`Channel`] can only be connected to a single peer at any one time. No
/// message routing or filtering is performed on messages sent over a [`Channel`] socket.
///
/// When a [`Channel`] socket enters the 'mute' state due to having reached the high water mark
/// for the connected peer, or, for connection-oriented transports, if the [`immediate()`]
/// option is set and there is no connected peer, then any [`send_msg()`] operation on the socket
/// shall block until the peer becomes available for sending; messages are not discarded.
///
/// While [`Channel`] sockets can be used over transports other than `inproc`, their inability to
/// auto-reconnect coupled with the fact new incoming connections will be terminated while any
/// previous connections (including ones in a closing state) exist makes them unsuitable for TCP
/// in most cases.
