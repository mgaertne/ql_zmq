/// A socket of type [`Request`] is used by a client to send requests to and receive replies from
/// a service. This socket type allows only an alternating sequence of [`send_msg()`] and
/// subsequent [`recv_msg()`] calls. Each request sent is round-robined among all services, and
/// each reply received is matched with the last issued request.
///
/// For connection-oriented transports, If the [`immediate()`] option is set and there is no
/// service available, then any send operation on the socket shall block until at least one service
/// becomes available. The [`Request`] socket shall not discard messages.
