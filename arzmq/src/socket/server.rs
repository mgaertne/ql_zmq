/// an incoming message: the [`Client`] peer must always initiate a conversation.
///
/// Each received message has a [`routing_id()`] that is a 32-bit unsigned integer. The application
/// can fetch this with [`routing_id()`] To send a message to a given [`Client`] peer the
/// application must set the peerâ€™s [`routing_id()`] on the message, using [`set_routing_id()`].
///
/// If the [`routing_id()`] is not specified, or does not refer to a connected client peer, the
/// send call will fail with [`HostUnreachable`]. If the outgoing buffer for the client peer is
/// full, the send call shall block, unless [`DONT_WAIT`] is used in the send, in which case it
/// shall fail with [`Again`]]. The [`Server`] socket shall not drop messages in any case.
